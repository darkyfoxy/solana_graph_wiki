# ZeroCiphertextProofData

The `ZeroCiphertextProofData` structure is used to prove in zero knowledge that an encrypted value (ciphertext) represents the value zero â€” without revealing any underlying information. This is especially useful in confidential token systems where encrypted balances must be verified for emptiness before allowing operations like account closure.

## Structure

**Encoding:** `POD`

**Size:** = 192 bytes

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `context` | `ZeroCiphertextProofContext` | Contains the ElGamal ciphertext that is claimed to be zero. |
| `proof` | `ZeroCiphertextProof` | A zero-knowledge proof that the ciphertext indeed encrypts the value zero. |

## ZeroCiphertextProofContext

The ZeroCiphertextProofContext structure provides the contextual data required to verify a zero-ciphertext proof in a confidential transfer system.

**Encoding:** `POD`

**Size:** = 96 bytes

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `pubkey` | `ElGamalPubkey` | The ElGamal public key used to encrypt the ciphertext. |
| `ciphertext` | `ElGamalCiphertext` | The ElGamal ciphertext being proved to encrypt the value zero. |
