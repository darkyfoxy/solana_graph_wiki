# Token Account

A **Token Account** is a user-facing account used to hold balances of an SPL token.
Each Token Account is linked to a specific [**Mint**](https://wiki.solanagraph.com/Native_programs/SPL_Token/Mint_account.md) and an **owner**, and keeps track of the number of tokens held, delegated, or locked.

Token Accounts are created for each user (or contract) who wants to hold tokens, and they are **separate from the** [**Mint**](https://wiki.solanagraph.com/Native_programs/SPL_Token/Mint_account.md) itself.
