# Token-2022 Extensions

The Token-2022 Program introduces a powerful extension framework that allows mint and token accounts to be extended with optional, modular functionality â€” without changing the core account layout.

## TLV Format

Each extension is stored in the account data as a TLV entry:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `type` | `u16` | Extension type, identified by `ExtensionType`. |
| `length` | `u16` | Length of the extension data in bytes. |
| `value` | `[...]` | Extension-specific data structure. |


## ExtensionType

This enum defines all supported extensions and maps directly to the type field in TLV entries.
Mint extensions can only be used on mint accounts; account extensions only on token holding accounts.

| Value | Variant | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| 0 | `Uninitialized` | Placeholder or padding entry. |
| 1 | `TransferFeeConfig` | Transfer fee rate settings and authorities. |

| 3 | `MintCloseAuthority` | Optional authority to allow mint closure. |
| 4 | `ConfidentialTransferMint` | Auditor settings for confidential transfers. |
| 5 | `ConfidentialTransferAccount` | Confidential transfer state and balances. |
| 6 | `DefaultAccountState` | Default state for new token accounts. |
