# Solana Graph

Welcome to **Solana Graph** — your visual gateway into the world of on-chain data!
Explore the complex relationships between Solana accounts, programs, and transactions like never before.
## What is Solana Graph?

**Solana Graph** is a blockchain explorer and analysis tool designed to help you view, understand, and map the connections between accounts, instructions, and on-chain programs in the Solana blockchain.

Instead of just showing raw data, Solana Graph builds interactive graphs that reveal how accounts and smart contracts are linked — making it easier to study protocols, debug contracts, or simply learn how Solana works.

For every address or instruction, we show what it's related to — and how. It’s like a social network of blockchain data!

## Solana Graph Wiki

Alongside the graph explorer, we’re building a public [wiki](https://wiki.solanagraph.com) — a collaborative knowledge base about:

- 📁 Account data structures

- ⚙️ Smart contracts and their instructions

- 🧪 Usage guides & dev tools **(planned)**

## Project Status

Solana Graph is currently in early-stage development. Expect things to evolve quickly as we build more features and improve the interface. 🛠️

Your feedback is incredibly valuable — suggestions, bug reports, and ideas are always welcome!
